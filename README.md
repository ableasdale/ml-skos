MarkLogic SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) Editor


Installation notes
==================

1. Open setup.xqy
2. Ensure you have set the $path-to-application-modules path accordingly so the Application Modules can be read from the filesystem
3. Execute the query in Query Console; this should create the database, set up the necessary range indexes and configure the application server

Run the application by going to localhost:9994 (the default port) and logging in with your normal admin username and password
